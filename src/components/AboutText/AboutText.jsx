                <p className='about-text'>
                    I'm passionate about all things creating! Whether building a website or directing a music video, I am always looking for ways to problem solve
                    and flex that creative muscle! I consider myself a generalist of many synergetic disciplines. This sets me apart because I can see projects through
                    from a mockup on a notepad, to a fully produced, professional asset with my skills in video production and editing, photography, motion graphics,
                    content marketing and web development. I am always excited to get my hands on creative projects that will help me improve my skills,
                    learn new things and stay curious! I'm a team player and can adapt to critique quickly and efficiently. I graduated from
                    the University of Utah in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Marketing and a minor in Documentary Studies.
                    In April 2024 I received a certificate from the University of Utah Professional Education Boot Camps
                    for Full Stack Web Development.</p>
